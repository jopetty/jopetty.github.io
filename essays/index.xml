      <description>A contractarian account of ethics holds that morality is the name we give to the rules of human conduct which would arise if rational parties deliberated what rules would best serve to protect people’s fundamental interests. A worthy concern with this approach arises when we consider how atypical bargainers fit into this picture. For example, while contractarianism may provide good protections for healthy, normal adults, very young children, very weak people, and those gripped by physical or mental illness cannot be considered typical, rational arbiters, and so may not have a seat at the bargaining table.</description>

      <description>A Kantian account of ethics holds that morality rests in the nature of human freedom. A sound critique of this analysis arises if one believes that true freedom means that one may act in any way one sees fit, and thus that true morality cannot ever be based on freedom since morality requires a set of rules for how one ought to act. In this essay I will begin by furthering the claims of the objection before defending the Kantian account of morality by first justifying why human freedom is compatible with one’s actions being bound by a particular set of rules, and then arguing how morality is based in human freedom by connecting the formulation of the categorical imperative as a test of universal laws to the respect for and consideration of dignity and autonomy by the laws which the categorical imperative permits.</description>
