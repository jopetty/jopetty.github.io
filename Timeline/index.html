                <p>In 1942, the international agency known as the United Nations was created by a group representing 26 countries fighting against the Axis powers of WWII <cite>("The United Nations Is Born")</cite>. Aside from being an alliance against the Axis powers, the UN sought to resolve conflict in a peaceful way instead of entering into wars such as WWI and WWII. The UN's mission is similar to that of the League of Nations, a supranational body which was created after World War I, but was ultimately unable to successfully broker peace among its representative countries, setting the stage for the Second World War <cite>("Histoire ...")</cite>. The United Nations is comprised of representatives from all member nations, and is organized into assemblies which seek to deliberate upon and advance issues relating to peacekeeping or security, human rights, economic development, and humanitarian assistance. The United Nations represents an early step in the development of supranational bodies of power. As an intergovernmental organization, the UN can take military action, investigate accounts of human rights violations, and maintain international security <cite>("Security Council ...")</cite>.</p>

                <p>The Arab League is an organization dedicated to furthering the development, culture, and communications of the participating Arab countries <cite>("The Avalon Project ...")</cite>. It is a regional organization whose members are selected from a group of countries on the basis of location and culture heritage. The group seeks to protect the interests of the Arab world through the coordination of policy decisions, settling conflicts and disputes between members, and enacting economic and social change in the regions it administers. The Arab League represents an organization that does not claimsovereignty over its member states, but instead seeks to aid them by providing political, economic, or even military assistance. Functioning as a kind of assembly for Arab states, it can have impacts on foreign relations, sovereign recognition, and cultural policies. While the Arab League does not directly make policy decisions or interact with citizens in the same way as its constituent members, it does show how a group of states can function on an international level to make decisions which could be made independently.</p>

                <p>The Schengen Agreement is an international treaty signed by 26 European countries creating an effectively borderless region for all travellers within the Schengen Area. People within the Schengen Area can move freely between the participating countries without the need for a passport check or other forms of border control <cite>("EUR-Lex ...")</cite>. The treaty was created in 1995, and has been ratified by all members of the European Union, except for Ireland and the United Kingdom, and by four states outside of the EU. People wishing to travel anywhere in Europe can use a common visa, even though they are travelling between sovereign countries. The Schengen Agreement makes travel easier for residents and visitors as well as facilitating the movement of goods or services throughout the region. Because of its creation, the Area blurs the lines of what defines a country for people inside the region; while each state has its own set of laws and government, the participating countries can function as a single unit with regards to travel and movement. In addition to changing how individual persons can move between countries, the Schengen Agreement has also changed how countries coordinate with each other to ensure safety and security, requiring cooperation of police and judicial authorities from different states. <cite>("EUROPA.")</cite></p>

This was the first time the United Nations Security Council had authorized an offensive force, in the past restricting its deployments to a purely defensive role. Not only is this part of the largest peacekeeping force in UN history, it also sets a new precedent for the organization. With this resolution, UN peacekeepers now have the authority to act as a combative military force not controlled by a single sovereign state. While this decision has been met with some criticism, it was unanimously adopted by the Security Council <cite>("'Intervention Brigade' ...")</cite>. Resolution 2098 is demonstrative of an international organization assuming a role that is both combative and supported by the states which it impacts, but it may also compromise the perceived neutrality of the UN by moving away from the more easily defensible position of defensive peacekeepers <cite>(Raghavan)</cite>.</p>

                <p>The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is an international financial institution created in 2014 to help fund infrastructure projects in Asian Countries. Although focused on a specific region, membership in the AIIB is not limited to Asian countries, and states such as South Africa and Brazil are also involved. The AIIB is seen by some as an attempt to rival the Western international economic institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The AIIB is an example of an organization that exists above the level of individual states that can have a major impacts on governments and people by influencing how developing countries <cite>(Zarroli)</cite>. The creation of competing supranational organizations like the AIIB, the IMF, and the World Bank represent an effort to change how people and nations interact with each other while bypassing the conventional approach of unilateral assistance provided by a single sovereign state. In addition to providing more assistance than the current framework, under IMF and World Bank, the AIIB will be able to contribute more towards development than individual governments <cite>(Stiglitz)</cite>.</p>

                <p>In early 2015, Palestine joined the International Criminal Court (ICC), an organization dedicated to pursuing justice for major crimes including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity <cite>(Human Rights Watch)</cite>. Palestine's decision lends credibility to the ICC which has been ratified by most countries in the world with some notable exceptions, like the United States. Although the ICC has made relatively few verdicts, its work has made significant headway in pursuing international justice. The ICC provides a legal forum for states to settle disputes and for oppressed peoples to seek justice against parties which cannot be controlled by a state. The authority of an organization like the ICC shows that international groups can resolve conflict and promote justice even though they do not directly control populations of individuals. When groups like the UN Security Council and later the ICC act with the ability to enforce decisions, judicial processes circumvent the need for a single state to deal with issues that it cannot fully control or to which it cannot effectively respond <cite>(Security Council)</cite>.</p>

                <p>In April of 2063, the world saw the greatest achievement of the Internet since its inception in the 1970s and 1980s: world wide access for almost all people. By expanding the range of mobile communications to include previously inaccessible areas, lowering the cost of access so that Internet use became within the means of people in developing countries, and increasing the relevancy of the internet to people through economic development and increasing native language content online <cite>("State of Connectivity ...")</cite>, the use of and access to the Internet has risen above 95% by population. Along with the increase in access has come the globalizing forces associated with instant online content. Some fear that ubiquitous access to the Internet will lead to the further spread of 'Western' culture due to the disproportionate amount of English-language content per user. The new use of the World Wide Web has also brought greater participation of people in international affairs like commerce and communication, particularly from developing countries which did not previously have access to such media. It is still uncertain how exactly this level of access will alter the traditional lifestyles of people who did not use the Internet before, but it is likely that they will be brought in closer and closer contact with the rest of the world, becoming more interdependent and more involved with a worldwide network of economic and cultural exchange.</p>

                <p>The notion of Europe is redefined as the European Union (EU), formerly a collection of supranational institutions based in Europe, is reincorporated as a single, sovereign state. Building upon the framework provided by the Schengen Agreement, the European Central Bank, the European Parliament, and the other organizations formerly comprising the EU, this action turns European citizenship into a form of national citizenship. Non-sovereign countries in the EU still maintain a degree of authority, but the EU has become the definite source of governmental power in Europe. While this decision has a comparatively small impact on the domestic affairs of European countries, due to the formerly high levels of interstate cooperation and integration, European participation in international affairs is substantially changed. Seats occupied by European countries on international agencies, like the United Nations, have been replaced by commonly held EU seats, and the EU in turn holds elections to determine who their representatives to these international organizations are. The integration into the new EU has brought about greater levels of interconnectedness between nations in Europe, leading to more centralized policy decisions and a stronger collective identity for EU citizens.</p>

                <p>In response to the ever growing presence of globalization on the world economy and the market crashes of the early and mid 21st century, the financial institutions of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, World Trade Organization, and other associated organizations have merged to create a single bank, supporting a state-neutral and global currency. The Central Bank is regulated as part of the United Nations, and serves as a global distributor of currency in an attempt to avoid hyperinflation and make international commerce more efficient. As resolved by the UN, the adoption of the new currency is not required for member states but is encouraged. The development of a single financial institution shows how attempts to create a more stable world economy an promote trade can be linked to the development of supranational organizations. In this case, the Central Bank has attempted to globalize and unify economic interactions at a level above that of states or even former financial institutions.</p>

                <p>By the beginning of the year 2120, the separate and sovereign states of the world have merged under a single government. Following the expansion of power by the United Nations, all sovereign countries who were previously member states have now become constituent parts of a unified, global government. While a single entity, the new world government is most accurately described as a federated republic, with each former sovereign state still maintaining some level of autonomy; this allows the nations to retain cultural and marginal political and economic separation from one another, avoiding a completely homogenized society. Policy decisions regarding the economy, security, and internal relations are made by the analogue of the former UN General Assembly, where each nation gets a single vote in a deliberative assembly. Travel among the nations of the global government is not restricted for citizens, and anyone can move freely between countries for work, travel, or residency. Each country has state level authority for legislative, executive, and judicial action, but is subject to the regulations and oversight of a global authority. The transition to a fully global government represents the culmination of the trend towards globalization; peoples of the world are more closely united than ever before, although it is unlikely that problems such as corruption, inaction, and ineffective governance are relics of the past.</p>
