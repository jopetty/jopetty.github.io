  The hexagon is the least-perimeter tile in the Euclidean plane for any given area. On hyperbolic surfaces, this &ldquo;isoperimetric&rdquo; problem differs for every given area, as solutions do not scale. Cox conjectured that a regular <em>k</em>-gonal tile with 120-degree angles is isoperimetric. For area π/3, the regular heptagon has 120-degree angles and therefore tiles many hyperbolic surfaces. For other areas, we show the existence of many tiles but provide no conjectured optima. On closed hyperbolic surfaces, we verify via a reduction argument using cutting and pasting transformations and convex hulls that the regular 7-gon is the optimal n-gonal tile of area π/3 for 3 ≤ <em>n</em> ≤ 10. However, for <em>n</em> &gt; 10, it is difficult to rule out non-convex <em>n</em>-gons that tile irregularly.

  In 1993 Foisy et al. proved that the optimal Euclidean planar double bubble &mdash; the least-perimeter way to enclose and separate two given areas &mdash; is three circular arcs meeting at 120 degrees. We consider the plane with density <em>r<sup>p</sup></em>, joining the surge of research on manifolds with density after their appearance in Perelman&rsquo;s 2006 proof of the Poincaré Conjecture. Dahlberg et al. proved that the best single bubble in the plane with density <em>r<sup>p</sup></em> is a circle through the origin. We conjecture that the best double bubble is the Euclidean solution with one of the vertices at the origin, for which we have verified equilibrium (first variation or &ldquo;first derivative&rdquo; zero). To prove the exterior of the minimizer connected, it would suffice to show that least perimeter is increasing as a function of the prescribed areas. We give the first direct proof of such monotonicity for the Euclidean case. Such arguments were important in the 2002 Annals proof of the double bubble in Euclidean 3-space.

  A contractarian account of ethics holds that morality is the name we give to the rules of human conduct which would arise if rational parties deliberated what rules would best serve to protect people’s fundamental interests. A worthy concern with this approach arises when we consider how atypical bargainers fit into this picture. For example, while contractarianism may provide good protections for healthy, normal adults, very young children, very weak people, and those gripped by physical or mental illness cannot be considered typical, rational arbiters, and so may not have a seat at the bargaining table.

  A Kantian account of ethics holds that morality rests in the nature of human freedom. A sound critique of this analysis arises if one believes that true freedom means that one may act in any way one sees fit, and thus that true morality cannot ever be based on freedom since morality requires a set of rules for how one ought to act. In this essay I will begin by furthering the claims of the objection before defending the Kantian account of morality by first justifying why human freedom is compatible with one’s actions being bound by a particular set of rules, and then arguing how morality is based in human freedom by connecting the formulation of the categorical imperative as a test of universal laws to the respect for and consideration of dignity and autonomy by the laws which the categorical imperative permits.
